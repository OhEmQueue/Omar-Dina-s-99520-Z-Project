We will do the movements suuuuuper slow and controlled - to keep the tension as long as possible in the muscles & to build maximum strength. The burn is REAL.  \u00a0\n\nNo High Intensity, rather slooooow motion :)\u00a0\nThose 15min will be fun - you got this! No excuses guys!\n\n__\n\nThis method is called \"time under tension\". We extend the eccentric phase of a movement (going down in a squat, lowering your body in a push up), hold for a second & go back to the starting position explosively. I will \"count\" you through the entire 15min haha:\n1, 2, 3, 4 - hold - AND UP \u2665\ufe0e\n\nIf you usually have troubles with \"feeling\" an exercise in the right place, you will probably have a better mind-muscle connection during this workout! \n\n__\n\nNo Equipment needed.

We will do the movements suuuuuper slow and controlled - to keep the tension as long as possible in the muscles & to build maximum strength. The burn is REAL.  \u00a0\n\nNo High Intensity, rather slooooow motion :)\u00a0\nThose 15min will be fun - you got this! No excuses guys!\n\n__\n\nThis method is called \"time under tension\". We extend the eccentric phase of a movement (going down in a squat, lowering your body in a push up), hold for a second & go back to the starting position explosively. I will \"count\" you through the entire 15min haha:\n1, 2, 3, 4 - hold - AND UP \u2665\ufe0e\n\nIf you usually have troubles with \"feeling\" an exercise in the right place, you will probably have a better mind-muscle connection during this workout! \n\n__\n\nNo Equipment needed. No Rests. Not much space needed.\u00a0\n\n\u25b8 You can find free WORKOUT SCHEDULES on my Instagram Channel.

It\u2019s a \u201eFull Body\u201c Session\n\nI\u2019m actually super excited for this, since I really need to step up my stretching skills :D and I\u2019m optimistic that I will stick to this better, if I will have a fix video that I can follow haha.

The original routine I designed was so hard, that even I struggled towards the end. My Instagram Community decided with 60% majority to make the routine a little easier - so we actually have a chance to survive those 10min :D\n \n= NOW we have an intense (but manageable routine) to built serious core strength. \nAnd of course, sliding with socks is a fun twist to our usual bodyweight routines :) Don't wear white socks tho, unless you want to see how dirty your floor was before :D\n\n__\n\nEquipment: Socks or Sliders\n\nNo breaks, no noise & not much space needed :) If you need a break tho - take it! Just don't fully quit! The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing 30s for each exercise. \n\n__\n\nI recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles.\n\u25b8  I have FREE WORKOUT SCHEDULES on my Instagram account.

                "description": "a knee friendly Booty Activation Workout, that doesn't involve any squats, lunges or jumps. \nThis way, we can also put a bigger focus on BOOTY isolation & train less of our thighs. / Anzeige\n\nIf you ...\n- only feel your thighs burning during squats\n- have troubles with isolating your butt muscles \n- have bad joints or\n- suffer from knee pain \n... this workout could work for you! \u2665\ufe0e let's make those stubborn glutes burn & grow! \n\n__\n\nAdding a resistance band is definitely helpful to put more focus on the booty. I can especially recommend it, if you want to target the sides of your butt. In case you don't have a booty band yet - don't worry! You can still do this workout :)\n\nIt took me soooo long to make this workout a \"killer\" routine haha .. I always felt like the burn is not intense enough, so tried it over and over again, searching for better combinations and exercises. But now, we definitely have a killer routine which makes my butt cheeks shakeeee haha!! \n\n__\n\nIt's super important that you pay attention to those \"rules\":\n1) squeeze your butt for every repetition\n2) move your leg with the \"strength\" of your glutes and think about your butt cheeks leading every movement  \n3) don't release tension and relax at the lower point of the motion (e.g. the lower point of a glute bridge), but rather HOLD the tension during the entire movement and squeeze \"even more\" at the upper point of the motion. \n\n__\n\nIf you need breaks - TAKE THEM! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing 30s for each exercise. \n\n__\n\n\u25b8 you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.

                    "description": "a knee friendly Booty Activation Workout, that doesn't involve any squats, lunges or jumps. \nThis way, we can also put a bigger focus on BOOTY isolation & train less of our thighs. / Anzeige\n\nIf you ...\n- only feel your thighs burning during squats\n- have troubles with isolating your butt muscles \n- have bad joints or\n- suffer from knee pain \n... this workout could work for you! \u2665\ufe0e let's make those stubborn glutes burn & grow! \n\n__\n\nAdding a resistance band is definitely helpful to put more focus on the booty. I can especially recommend it, if you want to target the sides of your butt. In case you don't have a booty band yet - don't worry! You can still do this workout :)\n\nIt took me soooo long to make this workout a \"killer\" routine haha .. I always felt like the burn is not intense enough, so tried it over and over again, searching for better combinations and exercises. But now, we definitely have a killer routine which makes my butt cheeks shakeeee haha!! \n\n__\n\nIt's super important that you pay attention to those \"rules\":\n1) squeeze your butt for every repetition\n2) move your leg with the \"strength\" of your glutes and think about your butt cheeks leading every movement  \n3) don't release tension and relax at the lower point of the motion (e.g. the lower point of a glute bridge), but rather HOLD the tension during the entire movement and squeeze \"even more\" at the upper point of the motion. \n\n__\n\nIf you need breaks - TAKE THEM! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing 30s for each exercise. \n\n__\n\n\u25b8 you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.

If you have bad joints or suffer from knee pain - this workout could work for you! \u2665\ufe0e / Anzeige \n\nIt's super important that you THINK about your glutes during every second of those 15min and try to make them BURN. Means you try to \n1) squeeze your butt for every repetition\n2) move your leg with the \"strength\" of your glutes and not by swinging \n3) don't release tension and relax at the lower point of the motion (e.g. the lower point of a glute bridge), but rather KEEP the tension during the entire movement and squeeze \"even more\" at the upper point of the motion. \n\n__\n\nIf you need breaks - TAKE THEM! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling!

Mine were getting super excited when they finally heard \"their kind of music\" :D plus it's beginner friendly. No Burpees or Jump Squats involved. \n\nListen, cardio is definitely NOT boring in today's routine! I had the best time creating & filming this video. Felt a little shy at first, but after a couple of side steps I was definitely singing along. Thank god we remove the original sound lol. \n\nWhen I did this routine 4x in a row (testing my workouts takes time) I burned the same amount of calories as I normally do during the other workouts!!! \nAlso nevermind the exercise names haha. The \"Wood Chopper\" should rather be called the \"John Travolta\". \n\n__\n\nNo Equipment needed & you can follow everything I do for 30 seconds. We don't have breaks - but I'm pretty sure they are REALLY not necessary here.

                    "description": "ok - quarantine is kicking in for me haha.. a DANCE WORKOUT with 80s music - this is a guarantee to get into a HAPPY MOOD and put a smile on your face :) even Dennis was smiling behind the camera!  / Werbung \n\nPS: ASK YOUR PARENTS TO JOIN! Mine were getting super excited when they finally heard \"their kind of music\" :D plus it's beginner friendly. No Burpees or Jump Squats involved. \n\nListen, cardio is definitely NOT boring in today's routine! I had the best time creating & filming this video. Felt a little shy at first, but after a couple of side steps I was definitely singing along. Thank god we remove the original sound lol. \n\nWhen I did this routine 4x in a row (testing my workouts takes time) I burned the same amount of calories as I normally do during the other workouts!!! \nAlso nevermind the exercise names haha. The \"Wood Chopper\" should rather be called the \"John Travolta\". \n\n__\n\nNo Equipment needed & you can follow everything I do for 30 seconds. We don't have breaks - but I'm pretty sure they are REALLY not necessary here. This is Beginner Friendly! :) \n\n__\n\n\u25b8 you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations. Check out the Highlight Bubble \"Workout Plans\" for that.  \n\n\u279e Instagram http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\n\n__\n \n\u25b8 I update my workout playlist weekly & it's available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. \u2665\ufe0e\nhttp://wmg.click/GetActive\n\n1. Chaka Khan - Ain't Nobody 0:00 - 3:57 \n2. Phil Collins - You Can't Hurry Love 3:58 - 6:36\n3. a-ha - Take On Me  6:37 - 8:49\n4.

HAPPY MOOD? \u2665\ufe0e\nI'm really not a dancer, but this song makes me do a Side Step real quick :D / Werbung \n\nThis Song Workout is great as a general WARM UP for the entire body :) we have leg movement, get our hips a little more loose, shake out our arms and increase our heart rate. This could even count as cardio, if you repeat it several times!  \n\n__\n\nA \"Song Workout\" fits to a specific song and is similar to a small \"choreography\". This means we are not doing  30s per exercise - we are doing a new movement as soon as the beat of the song changes. \n\n1. You can find the names of the exercises at the top right. \n2. You will need to PAY MORE ATTENTION. There are no beeps that will tell you that we start with a new movement. Either watch the video 1x before joining me or keep your eyes on the screen! \n3. Just have FUN. In those 3 minutes it's all about getting into the mood to do a proper workout and enjoy some nice music. \n4. A quick song workout is always a good idea :) you can do it in the morning to kickstart your day, as a warmup before a more intense workout or on its own for a quick sweat.\n\n__\n\n\u25b8 Song: \"Lonely\" by Joel Corry \n\nYou can always find ALL SONGS in my workout playlist: http://wmg.click/GetActive\nCheck it out and tell me which song I should use next time! \nI update it weekly & it's available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.\n\n__\n\n\u279e Instagram http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\n\u279e Food Account http://www.instagram.com/pamgoesnuts/\n\n__\nunterst\u00fctzt durch Warner Music Germany\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhen joining me for this workout video, you need to take some precautions as your health and safety is the most important.\u00a0To avoid any injury or harm, you need to check your health with your doctor before exercising.\u00a0By performing any fitness exercises without supervision like with this video, you are performing them at your own risk.

HAPPY MOOD? \u2665\ufe0e\nI'm really not a dancer, but this song makes me do a Side Step real quick :D / Werbung \n\nThis Song Workout is great as a general WARM UP for the entire body :) we have leg movement, get our hips a little more loose, shake out our arms and increase our heart rate. This could even count as cardio, if you repeat it several times!  \n\n__\n\nA \"Song Workout\" fits to a specific song and is similar to a small \"choreography\". This means we are not doing  30s per exercise - we are doing a new movement as soon as the beat of the song changes. \n\n1. You can find the names of the exercises at the top right. \n2. You will need to PAY MORE ATTENTION. There are no beeps that will tell you that we start with a new movement. Either watch the video 1x before joining me or keep your eyes on the screen! \n3. Just have FUN. In those 3 minutes it's all about getting into the mood to do a proper workout and enjoy some nice music. \n4. A quick song workout is always a good idea :) you can do it in the morning to kickstart your day, as a warmup before a more intense workout or on its own for a quick sweat.\n\n__\n\n\u25b8 Song: \"Lonely\" by Joel Corry \n\nYou can always find ALL SONGS in my workout playlist: http://wmg.click/GetActive\nCheck it out and tell me which song I should use next time! \nI update it weekly & it's available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.\n\n__\n\n\u279e Instagram http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\n\u279e Food Account http://www.instagram.com/pamgoesnuts/\n\n__\nunterst\u00fctzt durch Warner Music Germany\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhen joining me for this workout video, you need to take some precautions as your health and safety is the most important.\u00a0To avoid any injury or harm, you need to check your health with your doctor before exercising.\u00a0By performing any fitness exercises without supervision like with this video, you are performing them at your own risk.

                "description": "If you want to grow + shape your BOOTY, it's super duper important to activate those muscles properly & feeeeel them working. A good question is always: when doing squats - does your BOOTY burn or do you only feel your THIGHS? / Anzeige\n\nThose exercises are amazing to target your glutes and really set them on FIRE. I get the best results when I add a resistance band / booty band around my thighs. This forces the sides of my butt to work even harder & reminds me every second of those 10 minutes to engage my booty properly :D \nYou can also perform this workout without the band .. but I would really recommend you try it with one :) \n\nI do this routine at home or BEFORE I have a leg day with weights. Also for heavy squats, deadlifts, etc: I always make sure I do a booty activation session beforehand, so I hit the muscles in the right way. \n\n__\n\n\u2665\ufe0e Your stuck with me for those 10 minutes anyways .. so make sure you use them wisely:\n\n1. Training legs is a lot about the mind-muscle connection. I always try to THINK about the muscle I want to work on (e.g. booty) and concentrate 100% on using this exact muscle when performing a movement. \nYou can do a squat without thinking about anything .. but you can also do a squat, pushing through your heel, pushing your knees outwards, using the strength of your butt on the way up & finally: SQUEEZE the butt cheeks at the top position. \n2. For all Squats: make sure to always push through your HEELS (back of your feet) on your way up. This puts more focus on the booty. \n3. Also try to keep your knees behind your toes when you squat down. This is more friendly for the knee joint. \n\n__\n\nIf you need more breaks - TAKE THEM! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing 30s for each exercise. \n\nI recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your body in another way: check out my Ab Workouts, Upper Body Routines or HIIT Videos.\n\n__\n\nyou can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.

                    "title": "10 MIN BOOTY ACTIVATION - to grow your glutes / optional: Resistance Band I Pamela Reif",
                    "description": "If you want to grow + shape your BOOTY, it's super duper important to activate those muscles properly & feeeeel them working. A good question is always: when doing squats - does your BOOTY burn or do you only feel your THIGHS? / Anzeige\n\nThose exercises are amazing to target your glutes and really set them on FIRE. I get the best results when I add a resistance band / booty band around my thighs. This forces the sides of my butt to work even harder & reminds me every second of those 10 minutes to engage my booty properly :D \nYou can also perform this workout without the band .. but I would really recommend you try it with one :) \n\nI do this routine at home or BEFORE I have a leg day with weights. Also for heavy squats, deadlifts, etc: I always make sure I do a booty activation session beforehand, so I hit the muscles in the right way. \n\n__\n\n\u2665\ufe0e Your stuck with me for those 10 minutes anyways .. so make sure you use them wisely:\n\n1. Training legs is a lot about the mind-muscle connection. I always try to THINK about the muscle I want to work on (e.g. booty) and concentrate 100% on using this exact muscle when performing a movement. \nYou can do a squat without thinking about anything .. but you can also do a squat, pushing through your heel, pushing your knees outwards, using the strength of your butt on the way up & finally: SQUEEZE the butt cheeks at the top position. \n2. For all Squats: make sure to always push through your HEELS (back of your feet) on your way up. This puts more focus on the booty. \n3. Also try to keep your knees behind your toes when you squat down. This is more friendly for the knee joint. \n\n__\n\nIf you need more breaks - TAKE THEM! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing 30s for each exercise. \n\nI recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your body in another way: check out my Ab Workouts, Upper Body Routines or HIIT Videos.\n\n__\n\nyou can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.

But what about something IN BETWEEN? \u2665\ufe0e / Werbung \n\nIf you're not a Beginner anymore, but the other videos are still a tiny bit too hard for you. This workout is for you! I hope I managed to find the perfect \"in between\" Level - a MEDIUM one. \nHave fun! :)\n\n__\n\nThe video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing 30s for each exercise. If you need a break - TAKE IT! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! \n\nI recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your body in another way: check out my Live Workouts (with talking + explanations), the 20min Full Body Workouts, Leg Workouts or the Song Workouts. \n\n\u25b8 you can find WORKOUT PLANS with those videos on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations. Check out the Highlight Bubble \"Workout Plans\" for that.  \n\u279e Instagram http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\n\n\n__\n\n\n\u25b8 You can always find ALL SONGS in my workout playlist. I update it weekly & it's available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. \u2665\ufe0e\nhttp://wmg.click/GetActive\n\n1. Deepend feat. She Keeps Bees - Desire 0:00 - 2:41\n2. Sam Feldt feat. Ella Henderson - Hold me Close 2:42 - 5:44\n3. Diplo, Sidepiece - On My Mind 5:45 - 9:30\n4.

I just enjoy the music and the exercises a loooot here. \n\nGrab yourself a towel or yoga mat & let's do this together! NO EXCUSES.\n\n_\n\nThe video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing 30s for each exercise. If you need more breaks - TAKE THEM! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! \n\nI recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your body in another way: check out my 10min Ab Workout, 20min Booty Workout or the Song Workouts. \n\n\u25b8 you can find WORKOUT PLANS with those videos on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations. Check out the Highlight Bubble \"Workout Plans\" for that.  \n\n\n__\n\n\u25b8 You can always find ALL SONGS in my workout playlist.

                    "description": "Ohhhh yes - a BEGINNER ab workout! \u2665\ufe0e / Werbung \n\nIf you have a hard time keeping up with my super intense \"10min Ab Workout\" and \"10min Sixpack Workout\"... THIS ONE IS FOR YOU :) \n\nEverybody starts somewhere and my other workouts require suuuper strong core muscles. That's why I really wanted to create an ab workout, that is suitable for beginners - while still being super effective. \n\nAnd listen.. it even includes BREAKS! :D \n(If you feel like it's too easy with the breaks though: just continue the last exercise during the break & jump into the new movement one once I start with it as well)\n\nMy mom tried this workout and said, that it's 100% manageable for her .. although she usually isn't so much into working out. That means: no excuses for you. GIVE IT A TRY \u2665\ufe0e\n\n__\n\nNo Equipment necessary and not much space needed :) The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing 30s for each exercise. There is a small break included and you can have a look at what exercise is up next. \n\nI recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles.\nI have more workouts that are suitable for beginners! Check out my \n- 20min Full Body Workout,\n- Good Morning Workout, \n- 10min Cool Down Routine or my \n- 10min Sexy Arm Workout\n \n__\n\n\u25b8 You can always find ALL SONGS in my workout playlist. I update it weekly & it's available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. \u2665\ufe0e\nhttp://wmg.click/GetActive\n\n1. \"In Your Eyes\" by Robin Schulz feat.

I could barely believe he confirmed this video shoot haha! But here we have the one & only JASON DERULO, being willing to suffer through my workout, an 8 minute ab routine. Filmed as a 1-take, no breaks, no cuts. He did suuuch a good job, he only took a teeny-tiny break for once! And I definitely made him SWEAT haha :D \n\nWe probably all know his songs \"Swalla\" (feat. Nicki Minaj & Ty Dolla $ign), \"Talk Dirty\" (feat. 2 Chainz), \"Wiggle\" (feat. Snoop Dogg), \"Whatcha Say\", \"Tip Toe\" (feat. French Montana) or \"Mamacita\" (feat. Farruko) - the list is literally endless. And today, we train on three of his new songs! \n\n__\n\nThe workout itself is a real killer. I love this new routine! \nIt combines \n1) Ab exercises: they make my muscles buuuurn like hell & \n2) HIIT movements: they burn lots of calories, bring the heart rate up and make us sweat\n \nNo Equipment necessary, no breaks and not much space needed :) The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever we are doing 30s for each exercise. \n\n__\n\n\u25b8 all songs on Jason's new album \"2Sides (Side 1)\"\n\n1. \"F It Up\" by Jason Derulo \n2. \"Talk With Your Body\" by Jason Derulo \n3. \"Be The One\" by Jason Derulo\n\n\u25b8 You can find all songs in my workout playlist.

                    "description": "a new killer Ab Workout + @Jason Derulo suffering with us on the yoga mat + his music... can this get any better?? / Werbung \n\nWell.. I could barely believe he confirmed this video shoot haha! But here we have the one & only JASON DERULO, being willing to suffer through my workout, an 8 minute ab routine. Filmed as a 1-take, no breaks, no cuts. He did suuuch a good job, he only took a teeny-tiny break for once! And I definitely made him SWEAT haha :D \n\nWe probably all know his songs \"Swalla\" (feat. Nicki Minaj & Ty Dolla $ign), \"Talk Dirty\" (feat. 2 Chainz), \"Wiggle\" (feat. Snoop Dogg), \"Whatcha Say\", \"Tip Toe\" (feat. French Montana) or \"Mamacita\" (feat. Farruko) - the list is literally endless. And today, we train on three of his new songs! \n\n__\n\nThe workout itself is a real killer. I love this new routine! \nIt combines \n1) Ab exercises: they make my muscles buuuurn like hell & \n2) HIIT movements: they burn lots of calories, bring the heart rate up and make us sweat\n \nNo Equipment necessary, no breaks and not much space needed :) The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever we are doing 30s for each exercise. \n\n__\n\n\u25b8 all songs on Jason's new album \"2Sides (Side 1)\"\n\n1. \"F It Up\" by Jason Derulo \n2. \"Talk With Your Body\" by Jason Derulo \n3. \"Be The One\" by Jason Derulo\n\n\u25b8 You can find all songs in my workout playlist. I update it weekly & it's available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. \u2665\ufe0e\nhttp://wmg.click/GetActive\n\n__\n\nJason's Social Media Channels:\n\n\u279e Instagram http://www.instagram.com/jasonderulo/\n\u279e YouTube @Jason Derulo \n\n__\n\nMy Social Media: \n\n\u279e Instagram http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\n\u279e Food Channel http://www.instagram.com/pamgoesnuts/\n\n___\nunterst\u00fctzt durch Warner Music Germany\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhen joining me for this workout video, you need to take some precautions as your health and safety is the most important.\u00a0To avoid any injury or harm, you need to check your health with your doctor before exercising.\u00a0By performing any fitness exercises without supervision like with this video, you are performing them at your own risk.

I think it's perfect if you struggle to keep up with my longer ab workouts. 3 minutes are manageable!! \n\nSo happy that you liked the idea & constantly asked me for a new one on instagram! I personally think this one is even more fun haha. I just love singing along this song!\n\n__\n\nA \"Song Workout\" fits to a specific song and is similar to a small \"choreography\". This means we are not doing  30s per exercise - we are doing a new movement as soon as the beat of the song changes. \n\n1. You can find the names of the exercises at the top right. \n2. You will need to PAY MORE ATTENTION. There are no beeps that will tell you that we start with a new movement. Either watch the video 1x before joining me or keep your eyes on the screen! \n3. Just have FUN. In those 3 minutes it's all about getting into the mood to do a proper workout, get a good burn and enjoy some nice music. \n4. In the morning to enhance your mood, as a warm up before your workout, as a nice buuuurn to end your workout or anytime during the day. A quick song workout is always a good idea :) \n\nI clearly got inspired by the amazing Maddie (MadFit), who I saw those kind of song workouts at for the first time!! I had a lot of fun doing them so I thought I just need to share this with my fit community as well :) \n\n__\n\n\u25b8 Song: \"10.000 Hours\" by Dan + Shay & Justin Bieber \n\nYou can always find ALL SONGS in my workout playlist: http://wmg.click/GetActive\nCheck it out and tell me which song I should use next month!

This means we are not doing  30s per exercise - we are doing a new movement as soon as the beat of the song changes. \n\n1. You can find the names of the exercises at the top right. \n2. You will need to PAY MORE ATTENTION. There are no beeps that will tell you that we start with a new movement. Either watch the video 1x before joining me or keep your eyes on the screen! \n3. Just have FUN. In those 3 minutes it's all about getting into the mood to do a proper workout, get a good burn and enjoy some nice music. \n4. In the morning to enhance your mood, as a warm up before your workout, as a nice buuuurn to end your workout or anytime during the day. A quick song workout is always a good idea :) \n\nI clearly got inspired by the amazing Maddie (MadFit), who I saw those kind of song workouts at for the first time!! I had a lot of fun doing them so I thought I just need to share this with my fit community as well :) \n\n__\n\n\u25b8 Song: \"10.000 Hours\" by Dan + Shay & Justin Bieber \n\nYou can always find ALL SONGS in my workout playlist: http://wmg.click/GetActive\nCheck it out and tell me which song I should use next month! I update it weekly & it's available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.\n\n__\n\n\u279e Instagram http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\n\u279e Food Account http://www.instagram.com/pamgoesnuts/\n\n__\nunterst\u00fctzt durch Warner Music Germany\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhen joining me for this workout video, you need to take some precautions as your health and safety is the most important.\u00a0To avoid any injury or harm, you need to check your health with your doctor before exercising.\u00a0By performing any fitness exercises without supervision like with this video, you are performing them at your own risk.

There are no beeps that will tell you that we start with a new movement. Either watch the video 1x before joining me or keep your eyes on the screen! \n4. just have FUN. In those 3 minutes it's all about getting into the mood to do a proper workout, get your heart rate up quickly and enjoy some nice music. \n\nI clearly got inspired by the amazing Maddie (MadFit), who I saw those kind of song workouts at for the first time!! I had a lot of fun doing them so I thought I just need to share this with my fit community as well :) \n\n\n \u25b8 Song: \"South of the Border\" by Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello & Cardi B\nYou can always find ALL SONGS in my workout playlist: http://wmg.click/GetActive\nCheck it out and tell me which song I should use next month! I update it weekly & it's available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.\n\n__\n\n\u279e Instagram http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\n\u279e Food Account http://www.instagram.com/pamgoesnuts/\n\n__\nunterst\u00fctzt durch Warner Music Germany\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhen joining me for this workout video, you need to take some precautions as your health and safety is the most important.\u00a0To avoid any injury or harm, you need to check your health with your doctor before exercising.\u00a0By performing any fitness exercises without supervision like with this video, you are performing them at your own risk.

Nutrition-wise my meals were plant-based and very high in healthy fats (lots of nuts, seeds, olives, pesto, coconut, ..), low in sugars (only fruit, no processed sugars at all) and medium protein. I had sports sessions every day. For example strength sessions in the gym, HIIT, water sports and one of my favorites: YOGA.

So make sure to give it a try! \u2665\ufe0e\n\n__\n\nLocation: \nVEELA PRIVATE ISLAND Maldives \n\nI did a 1-week training & nutrition program on the Maldives - it's called \"The Energizing Program\" - and followed a specific plan that they designed for me and my body type :) just a different and more active kind of vacation! Nutrition-wise my meals were plant-based and very high in healthy fats (lots of nuts, seeds, olives, pesto, coconut, ..), low in sugars (only fruit, no processed sugars at all) and medium protein. I had sports sessions every day. For example strength sessions in the gym, HIIT, water sports and one of my favorites: YOGA. Since I loved those yoga hours so much, I thought I'd share a part of this wonderful experience with you!! \u2665\ufe0e\n\nWebsite: www.velaaprivateisland.com \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/velaaprivateisland/\n\n__\n\nMy Social Media: \n\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\nFood Channel: http://www.instagram.com/pamgoesnuts/\nEmail: pamela_reif@icloud.com \n\n__\n\nMaulim's Social Media:\n \nhttps://www.instagram.com/maulimmitra/\n\n__\n\nBackground Sounds:\n\nbuy the MP3 https://gum.co/urCZy\n\nAudio by Doc Jon\nAudio was extended with the original found here:\nhttps://freesound.org/people/Doc%20Jo...\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/..\n\n__\n\na cooperation with VELAA Private Island.\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhen joining me for this workout video, you need to take some precautions as your health and safety is the most important.\u00a0To avoid any injury or harm, you need to check your health with your doctor before exercising.\u00a0By performing any fitness exercises without supervision like with this video, you are performing them at your own risk.

The people there loved it so much that I decided to film & publish it here as well \u2665\ufe0e \n\nTargets abs & glutes and is also perfect for people suffering form pain in there knees. No squats or lunges involved! \n\n\n1ST PART: similar to my 10min Sixpack Workout :) trains your abs from all angles. Also really focussing on lower abs & obliques here! \n2ND PART: combination of ab & booty exercises. \n3RD PART: ultimate booty burnout!!! Think about your booty muscles all the time to have the best mind-muscle connection. This is extremely knee friendly and doesn't involve any work of your quads. So we only get booty & hamstring gains right here :) \n\n\nYou don't need any equipment or weights. The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing. There are two 1min rests in between. If you need to pause longer - feel free to do so.

The people there loved it so much that I decided to film & publish it here as well \u2665\ufe0e \n\nTargets abs & glutes and is also perfect for people suffering form pain in there knees. No squats or lunges involved! \n\n\n1ST PART: similar to my 10min Sixpack Workout :) trains your abs from all angles. Also really focussing on lower abs & obliques here! \n2ND PART: combination of ab & booty exercises. \n3RD PART: ultimate booty burnout!!! Think about your booty muscles all the time to have the best mind-muscle connection. This is extremely knee friendly and doesn't involve any work of your quads. So we only get booty & hamstring gains right here :) \n\n\nYou don't need any equipment or weights. The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I\u2019m doing. There are two 1min rests in between. If you need to pause longer - feel free to do so. If you don't need a break - skip them! \n\nI recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover. You can do this workout 2-3x a week and if you want to do be active on the other days: check out my Sixpack, Plank, Core, Whole Body & Booty Workouts \u2665\ufe0e\n\n\n\u279e Instagram http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\n\u279e Food Account  http://www.instagram.com/pamgoesnuts/\n\n\nVIDEO, CUT & EDIT: Emrah Bayka \nhttps://www.instagram.com/emrahbayka/\nemrahbayka@gmail.com \n\n\nMUSIC by Epidemic Sound \nhttp://www.epidemicsound.com\n\n\nCONTACT ME (business inquires):\npamela_reif@icloud.com\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhen joining me for this workout video, you need to take some precautions as your health and safety is the most important.\u00a0To avoid any injury or harm, you need to check your health with your doctor before exercising.\u00a0By performing any fitness exercises without supervision like with this video, you are performing them at your own risk.
