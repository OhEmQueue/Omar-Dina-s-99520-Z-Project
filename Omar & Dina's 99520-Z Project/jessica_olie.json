Some days you\u2019ll have more to say than others and that\u2019s completely normal.\n1. Gratitude entry: write things you\u2019re grateful for. No matter how big or small.\n2. Write down your goals, your dreams, your aspirations. Use your journal to help manifest things that you want in your life. It\u2019s such a powerful way to use your thoughts to bring about meaningful changes in your life and your thought patterns.\n3. Write about your day.\n4. Talk about your relationships, what\u2019s happening in them.\n5. Discuss your insecurities and how you want to overcome them.\n6.
