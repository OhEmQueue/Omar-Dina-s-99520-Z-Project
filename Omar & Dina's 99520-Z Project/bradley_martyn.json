                "description": "What are the best upper chest exercises? What is the best way to build the upper chest? Upper chest is in my opinion on of the hardest areas to build. For me it has taken me the longest, compared to other body parts. So over the years I have learned a few specific exercises that I've noticed have really helped me grow my upper chest and I believe most importantly help me contract me whole chest more strongly...creating a better mind muscle connection to the chest itself. I think this is one of the most important factors to bringing up lagging body parts and getting through plateaus is to create a stronger mind muscle connection with those lagging body parts. The upper chest for me was always one of the harder body parts to get to grow, but these are a few exercises that helped me change the game! \n\nLet's get better together!\n\n\nINTERACT WITH ME!+\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/bradleymartyn\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/bradleymartyn\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/bradleymartyn\nSNAPCHAT: BRADLEYMARTYN\n\n=============================================\n\nBMFIT Gear And Apparel+\nBMFIT GEAR! : http://WWW.BMFITGEAR.COM\nBMFIT APPAREL!: http://www.bmfitshop.com\n\n=============================================\n\nORIGIN (SUPPLEMENTS):\nhttp://www.originsupps.com\n\n\n=============================================\n\nPERSONALIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS AND MEAL PLANS!\n#LETSGETBETTERTOGETHER\nhttp://WWW.BRADLEYMARTYN.COM/ONLINECOACHING\nAll the training in the world wont outwork a bad diet!\n\n=============================================\n\nJOIN MY EXCLUSIVE MEMBERSHIP SITE!\nhttp://www.bradleymartyn.com/joinbmfit\n\n=============================================",

For me it has taken me the longest, compared to other body parts. So over the years I have learned a few specific exercises that I've noticed have really helped me grow my upper chest and I believe most importantly help me contract me whole chest more strongly...creating a better mind muscle connection to the chest itself. I think this is one of the most important factors to bringing up lagging body parts and getting through plateaus is to create a stronger mind muscle connection with those lagging body parts. The upper chest for me was always one of the harder body parts to get to grow, but these are a few exercises that helped me change the game! \n\nLet's get better together!\n\n\nINTERACT WITH ME!+\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/bradleymartyn\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/bradleymartyn\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/bradleymartyn\nSNAPCHAT: BRADLEYMARTYN\n\n=============================================\n\nBMFIT Gear And Apparel+\nBMFIT GEAR! : http://WWW.BMFITGEAR.COM\nBMFIT APPAREL!: http://www.bmfitshop.com\n\n=============================================\n\nORIGIN (SUPPLEMENTS):\nhttp://www.originsupps.com\n\n\n=============================================\n\nPERSONALIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS AND MEAL PLANS!\n#LETSGETBETTERTOGETHER\nhttp://WWW.BRADLEYMARTYN.COM/ONLINECOACHING\nAll the training in the world wont outwork a bad diet!\n\n=============================================\n\nJOIN MY EXCLUSIVE MEMBERSHIP SITE!\nhttp://www.bradleymartyn.com/joinbmfit\n\n============================================="

But never forget everyday is still arm day!\n\nBuilding the best butt was harder than I thought lol\n\n\nINTERACT WITH ME!+\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/bradleymartyn\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/bradleymartyn\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/bradleymartyn\nSNAPCHAT: BRADLEYMARTYN\n\n\n=============================================\n\nBMFIT Gear And Apparel+\nBMFIT GEAR! : http://WWW.BMFITGEAR.COM\nBMFIT APPAREL!: http://www.bmfitshop.com\n\n=============================================\n\nORIGIN (SUPPLEMENTS):\nhttp://www.originsupps.com\n\n\n=============================================\n\nPERSONALIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS AND MEAL PLANS!\n#LETSGETBETTERTOGETHER\nhttp://WWW.BRADLEYMARTYN.COM/ONLINECOACHING\nAll the training in the world wont outwork a bad diet!\n\n=============================================\n\nJOIN MY EXCLUSIVE MEMBERSHIP SITE!\nhttp://www.bradleymartyn.com/joinbmfit\n\n=============================================\n\nhttp://www.instagram.com/michie_peachie\nhttp://www.instagram.com/90210extensions"

Well first u look around for Fs to give and realize there are none and then continue on grinding!! Not everyone is going to appreciate your vision. Not everyone is going to believe in your goals. THAT IS OKAY! THEY ARE NOT GIVEN THE SAME EYESIGHT AS YOU! Keep focused and understand your in a whole other lane. Your own lane that can only be affected if you allow it to (I think that was the proper use of affected vs effected not sure tho) anyways.

That's okay there is always next year..lol\n\nRemember guys the most important thing about moving into a new year...or any new day for that matter is that it is a chance to get better as a person. A chance to change something you don't like. A chance to be who you've always wanted to or thought u could be. Don't wait every year until a new year to decided this is the year for a new me. That opportunity happens everyday...every moment. You make a decision to either live in happiness or to let whatever negative or hardships in your life control the next \"few steps\". Take a moment today to be thankful for it ALL....the good the bad and the ugly. Understand that you have the power to make the best out of any situation that will come in your life.\n\nNo one said this would be easy...and damnit it is not...but I promise you it will be worth it. Ive gone through some low times in my life and continue even today to be challenged. Losing a father at 6 years old to suicide is something that stays for a while on your mind. What I've learned about life over the last few years and a lot of what you guys have taught me and continue to teach me is that no matter where u come from and what you've dealt with...things CAN GET BETTER. Things WILL GET BETTER. So again take this day...(and everyday is year) to be a better version of yourself. Grow from your mistakes in 2016 and step forward into 2017 like a fucking champ.

A heavy squat and a heavy deadlift should be a cornerstone of your leg training program no matter what the goal is: fat loss, muscle gain, getting bigger arms lol...whatever. But just because it should be a staple doesn't mean u can go have fun and change up your training program a bit here and there to maximize your results. A little bit of heavy weight leg press was on the agenda today. I've not used this piece of equipment like this for sometime, so it felt good! \n\nINTERACT WITH ME!+\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/bradleymartyn\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/bradleymartyn\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/bradleymartyn\nSNAPCHAT: BRADLEYMARTYN\n\n=============================================\n\nBMFIT Gear And Apparel+\nBMFIT GEAR! : http://WWW.BMFITGEAR.COM\nBMFIT APPAREL!: http://www.bmfitshop.com\n\n=============================================\n\nORIGIN (SUPPLEMENTS):\nhttp://www.bit.ly/bradleyorigin\n\n\n=============================================\n\nPERSONALIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS AND MEAL PLANS!\n#LETSGETBETTERTOGETHER\nhttp://WWW.BRADLEYMARTYN.COM/ONLINECOACHING\nAll the training in the world wont outwork a bad diet!\n\n=============================================\n\nJOIN MY EXCLUSIVE MEMBERSHIP SITE!\nhttp://www.bradleymartyn.com/joinbmfit\n\n============================================="

I will show u guys a ton more of the recovery techniques that I will be adding to my training program along the way to optimize my GAINZ, as well as focus on increasing my squat and deadlift over the next few weeks.\n\nINTERACT WITH ME!+\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/bradleymartyn\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/bradleymartyn\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/bradleymartyn\nSNAPCHAT: BRADLEYMARTYN\n\n=============================================\n\nBMFIT Gear And Apparel+\nBMFIT GEAR! : http://WWW.BMFITGEAR.COM\nBMFIT APPAREL!: http://www.bmfitshop.com\n\n=============================================\n\nORIGIN (SUPPLEMENTS):\nhttp://www.bit.ly/bradleyorigin\n\n\n=============================================\n\nPERSONALIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS AND MEAL PLANS!\n#LETSGETBETTERTOGETHER\nhttp://WWW.BRADLEYMARTYN.COM/ONLINECOACHING\nAll the training in the world wont outwork a bad diet!\n\n=============================================\n\nJOIN MY EXCLUSIVE MEMBERSHIP SITE!\nhttp://www.bradleymartyn.com/joinbmfit\n\n============================================="
